# ProcurePro Backend Technical Challenge

Hi Nathan, Tomm,

I completely agree with what you mentioned about not spending more than 2 hours on this, but eventually, I spent 2 days learning and implementing the challenges ðŸ˜….  
Previously, My only PHP experience was, I worked on modifying some PHP functions to perform custom operations on a WordPress website, but it wasnâ€™t as hands-on as this experience. This technical task was a great learning opportunity, I pushed myself to give my best in learning and solving the challenge.

## Learning Process

I started by reading all the instructions from the repo (concepts, setup, tasks). I went through the docs, and I understood the core concepts about pure functions and DTO. since I had previous project experience with Django, Symfony was Quite similar (MVC architecture, templates, make commands), and I was able to quickly grasp the core concepts.

### Tutorials I Followed:

1. **Symfony Basics**:  
   [Symfony in 1 Hour](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_jgWZItCGI&t=69s)  
   _(Basics of model, view, and controller, data fixtures, routing, Twig templates, make commands, Doctrine ORM, requests and responses, Symfony validator, form handling, repository patterns, profiler for detailed analysis)_

2. **Psalm for Static Analysis**:

## Implementation Details

I started writing the code by referring to the Symfony docs, Reddit discussions, and occasionally used ChatGPT for understanding some snippets and OOP concepts.

## Questions and Clarifications

### For The Given Failed Test Case:

- For example, the failed test case for the patch endpoint had an adjustment errorâ€”a typo (`'s'`).  
  So I removed `'s'` to satisfy the test case. was i supposed to do that?

### Validation Checks:

- Ensured validation checks for the price:
  - The discount canâ€™t be more than the price.
  - All inputs (price, unlet cost, adjustment, discount) canâ€™t have negative values.
- However, I wasnâ€™t sure whether I could assume that the price should be higher than all the other fields.  
  I inferred this from the schema of fakers in data fixtures.

- Because The formula mentioned in the docs is:  
  `final cost = price - discount + adjustment + unletCost`

This doesnâ€™t include parentheses following BODMAS rules.  
If it were written as:  
`final cost = price - (discount + adjustment + unletCost)`  
then I would have assumed that. I need some clarity on this.

### Currency Validation:

- If the user sends `500.30` from the frontend as `50030` in JSON:
  - The backend stores it in the database as `50030` and sends it back as an integer.
  - On the frontend, it will be interpreted as `500.30` by dividing it to get the actual price.
- So, **the validation should be done solely on the frontend**:

  - The frontend should multiply the value by `100` and send it via JSON to the backend.
  - This ensures that the backend stores the value correctly and no issues arise when sending it back to the frontend.

- Is it a good practice to rely solely on the frontend to send values correctly?

I attempted to send it as a string, parse it, validate it, store it as an integer, and send it back as a string. But I think thatâ€™s not a good idea for handling numbers. Any guidance on this would be really helpful.

## Challenges Faced

- I wrote test cases for all the endpoints and ensured that they passed.
- I wasn't able to run phpunit test in the phpstorm, but I ran all the unit tests and functional tests using the terminal and they passed.
- I havenâ€™t tried concurrent testing (e.g., passing concurrent requests to the same contractor to ensure persistence).
- I tried to pay maximum attention to address validation issues and test cases but might have missed something.
- I Have implemented private helper function to validate the name twice, once in the create and patch controller. do we need to refactor it to a separate service?
- I would love feedback on missed cases or how to optimize/approach problems better.

## Takeaways

This technical task gave me a good understanding of The MVC architecture in Symfony.Basics of PHP language, Brushed up on OOP concepts, type safety and static analysis, Learned about validations and test cases.

I now have a good grasp of the codebase, got blended with it ðŸ˜…!

I am eagerly waiting to discuss the challenges and the approach I implemented during the interview, also looking forward to learn more about the best practices and how to optimize the codebase and contribute effectively ðŸ’¯.
